// check to make sure that backward Q&A works for the question-judgement form

<(([filled] & rectangle) * {?1}) --> leftOf>?

// simplify task a bit
<{shape1} --> rectangle>.
<{shape1} --> [filled]>.
//<{shape1} --> ( [filled] & rectangle )>.

<({shape1} * {shape2}) --> leftOf>.

// this is the expected answer which leads to the answer of the original question
